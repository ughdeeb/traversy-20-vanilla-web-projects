## General info

I have thus far made it to web apps and React on the codecademy track, but I wanted more practice with vanilla javascript to really get the fundamentals down before jumping into React and other frameworks/libraries.
So I decided to work through Brad Traversy's Udemy course called [20 Web Projects with Vanilla Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) to build some projects using modern vanilla javascript.

Technologies used in the creation of this project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS ES5/ES6
- CLI
- Git and Github (with VS Code: I really want to get pushing to github from VScode into my muscle memory)
